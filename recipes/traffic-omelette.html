        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        
        <li>1 cup of unexpected road closures</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of a surprise detour</li>
        <li>A pinch of "I swear, it was out of my control"</li>

    <ol>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>

        <li>Add the surprise detour for that extra twist. It's as if the universe conspired to make you late.</li>
        
        <li>Sprinkle in a pinch of "I swear, it was out of my control" to emphasize that you are a victim of unfortunate circumstances.</li>
        
        <li>Mention the honking horns and frustrated drivers to paint a vivid picture of the chaos on the road.</li>
        
        <li>Continue with a generous sprinkle of "I left early, but life had other plans." This implies that you were responsible but life had different ideas.</li>
        
        <li>A dash of "Can you believe the luck I have?" adds a touch of sarcasm to your excuse.</li>
        
        <li>Conclude with a slice of humility, acknowledging that being late is not your preference, and you appreciate the understanding of others.</li>
