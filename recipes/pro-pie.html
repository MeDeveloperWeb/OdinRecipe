        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <li>1 cup of "I'll do it later" attitude</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of "One more episode won't hurt" distraction</li>

        <li>A generous dollop of "I'm waiting for the right moment" postponement</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        
        <li>Start by preheating your excuses to room temperature. You don't want them too hot to handle.</li>

        <li>Mix the "I'll do it later" attitude with the "One more episode won't hurt" distraction in a procrastinator's favorite bowl.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle in a pinch of "I work better under pressure" delusion for that extra flavor of self-deception.</li>

        <li>Gently fold in the scoops of "I deserve a break" justification and add the handful of "Let me check social media first" temptation. Be careful not to overindulge.</li>

        <li>Now, take your generous dollop of "I'm waiting for the right moment" postponement and spread it evenly over the mixture.</li>

        <li>Transfer everything to a comfy couch or bed, and let it sit for hours while you engage in activities that are not on your to-do list.</li>

        <li>Once you've successfully wasted time, serve your Procrastination Pie with a side of regret.</li>
            
        <p><b>Remember, this dish is best enjoyed when you have deadlines looming and a growing list of tasks to complete. It's the ultimate excuse recipe for putting things off until tomorrow, or the day after that, or... well, you get the idea! ðŸ˜‰</b></p>
    </ol>
