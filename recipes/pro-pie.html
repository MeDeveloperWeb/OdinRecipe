    <ul>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <li>1 cup of "I'll do it later" attitude</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of "One more episode won't hurt" distraction</li>
        <li>A pinch of "I work better under pressure" delusion</li>
        <li>3 scoops of "I deserve a break" justification</li>
        <li>A handful of "Let me check social media first" temptation</li>
        <li>A generous dollop of "I'm waiting for the right moment" postponement</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <li>In a separate pan, sautÃ© the skepticism over high heat until it turns golden brown. Keep doubting the intentions of the pasta.</li>

        <li>Pour in the "You Can't Be Serious" tomato sauce and stir while adding a pinch of irony. Let it simmer, giving it the "side-eye" treatment.</li>

        <li>Toss in the cooked spaghetti and add the confusion gradually. Make sure it's evenly distributed for maximum disorientation.</li>

        <li>As a final touch, sprinkle generous servings of grated sarcasm and absurdity over your dish. Stir with a smirk.</li>

        <li>Serve hot with a side of eye rolls and a glass of irony-laden red wine.</li>
    
        <p><b>Enjoy your Sarcastic Spaghetti Surprise, where every bite leaves you questioning the meaning of culinary seriousness! ðŸ˜„</b></p>
